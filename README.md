# ParkingAid


A 'ParkingAid' Android App created for 'UEA Open Days' as part of the Software Engineering II module. The app records the parking location of the car and enables the user to navigate back to it later. A reminder function and fee calculator are also included.

I was solely responsible for creating the application from scratch using Android Studio.
